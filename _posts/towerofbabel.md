# Tower of Babel

Here is your target:

[https://towerofbabel.matchthetarget.com/](https://towerofbabel.matchthetarget.com/){:target="_blank"}

## Getting started

You are starting almost from scratch; we've given you only one model, `Language`. This is to help to create the dropdown to select a language, so that you don't have to populate the options yourself.

You can fill the `Language` table with data with this command:

```
rails db:seed
```

Other than that, you're on your own! Build to match the target. You can `rails grade` once you think you're done; there aren't very many specs, just the essential ones testing the main functionality.
